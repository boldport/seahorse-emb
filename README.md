# The Seahorse

![Seahorse layout](/images/seahorse-emb.png)

The Seahorse is a PCB version of the low cost Arduino-compatible [Shrimp](http://shrimping.it/blog/shrimp/) that is designed for use in a fun 'wearable' application. The kit has two small detachable boards, for LED and IR-based projects -- the IR transmitter is on one of the small boards, and the IR receiver is on the main board -- using conductive threads.
